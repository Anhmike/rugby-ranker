Rugby Ranker is a **work-in-progess** Android app for viewing and predicting the latest World Rugby rankings.

It displays the latest international rankings, fixtures and results and makes use of the [World Rugby 'Points Exchange' system](https://www.world.rugby/rankings/explanation) in order to predict changes in team positions and points.

## Android development

Rugby Ranker attempts to make use of the latest Android libraries and best practices:
* Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) with [ktlint](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint) for code style
* Makes use of [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/), including:
  * All appropriate [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), including **Lifecycles**, **LiveData**, **ViewModel**, **Room**, **Paging**, **Navigation** and **WorkManager**
  * [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/constraint/ConstraintLayout) 2.0 for layouts
  * [EmojiCompat](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/emoji-compat) for emoji compatibility on older platforms
  * [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) for more fluent use of Android APIs
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for networking
* [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/) for dependency injection
* Designed and built using Material Design [tools](https://material.io/tools/) and [components](https://material.io/develop/android/)

## Inspiration

Rugby Ranker was inspired by [@rawling](https://github.com/rawling)'s [wr-calc](https://rawling.github.io/wr-calc/) web app, aiming to be a native Android version with a focus on delightful UX/UI design.
